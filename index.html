    <h2>A look at the Sly Cooper series made by Sucker Punch.</h2>
  <br>In this site I want to talk about the use of orchestral and jazz music. 
      The game is primarily a stealth game, with Sly sneaking his way around the various maps.
      The audio below is the main theme for Sly 3. </br>

</audio></br>
  <br>The Sly theme, along with the rest of the soundtrack, always seems to induce a subtle head bob. 
      The music is extremely groovy, and really enhances the feeling of stealth while playing as Sly.
      Massumi talks about the bodily nature of affect, and how aspects of a game can induce
      certain physical responses. In this case, the involuntary bob around to the groovy music induces 
      a vibe that connects you to the characters and the game. (note 1).</br>
<br>Here is the intro scene for Sly 4 Thieves In Time. Think about Freud's Pleasure Principle while
    watching this clip.</br>

  <br>In this intro, Sly talks about his relationship with Inspector Fox, and how he is lying about
      having amnesia in order to stay with her. This is the first example of Sly seeking pleasure,
      and his actions to achieve it. The next thing to note is that when Carmelita finds sly stealing 
      treasure, she immediately pursues him. Sly then takes off in a flash to avoid the pain of being 
      shocked by the pistol. This is an example of Sly giving up his relationship to avoid pain. (note 2).</br>
<br>In case you think that finds others like him will provide a sense of community, think again:</br>

  <br>These are murderous kids and if the boy fears them, he has good reason, as you as user are about to find
  out.</br>
